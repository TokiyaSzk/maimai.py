## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[maimai.py Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <truerou@outlook.com>.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://maimai.turou.fun/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you have questions about how to use maimai.py, how to implement something, or are experiencing issues that are not covered by the documentation, you can join our [QQ Group](https://qm.qq.com/q/1ULJ0VTT0k), or contact us directly via QQ (TuRou, 1822974018)

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (python, os, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://maimai.turou.fun/). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <truerou@outlook.com>.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for maimai.py, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://maimai.turou.fun/) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TrueRou/maimai.py/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and the built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most maimai.py users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

VSCode is a great tool to start contributing to maimai.py. It has built-in support for Python and Git, and it is available on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). You can find the [installation instructions here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

Specifically, for maimai.py, we recommend the following extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter)
- [isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort)

After finishing the setup, you can start contributing to maimai.py by following these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `feature/add-new-functionality` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`.
3. **Install the dependencies** using Poetry. You can do this by running `poetry install` in the terminal. This will create a virtual environment and install all the required packages.
4. **Make your changes** in the codebase. You can use the VSCode editor to edit the files, and the integrated terminal to run commands.
5. **Run the tests** to make sure everything is working as expected. You can run the `main.py` scripts in the `tests` to perform the tests. Before running the tests, ensure that you have make a copy of `.env.example `and rename it to `.env`, then fill in the required environment variables.
6. **Pull request your changes** to the **develop** branch of the main repository. Make sure to provide a clear description of your changes and why they are needed.

### Improving The Documentation

We use VitePress to generate the documentation for maimai.py. The documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `docs` directory of the repository. You can find the documentation [here](https://maimai.turou.fun/).

You can contribute to the documentation in the same PR as your code changes, or you can create a separate PR for individual documentation changes.

## Styleguides

### Branch

We use the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. The main branch is `develop`, and all changes should be made in feature branches. When you are ready to merge your changes, create a pull request to the `develop` branch.

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to format the code.

```json
{
  "black-formatter.args": [
    "--line-length",
    "150"
  ]
}
```

> If you are using VSCode, you can install the [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) and [isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort) extensions to format the code automatically on save.

### Code Linting

We use Pyright for type checking and linting. It is part of the [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension for VSCode.

```json
{
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "standard"
}
```
